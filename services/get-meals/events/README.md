## 🧭 Overview

This module manages the ingestion and indexing of meal data using AWS DynamoDB. It contains two key Lambda functions:

1. **S3 Upload Listener** - Responds to S3 upload notifications via EventBridge and inserts structured records into DynamoDB.
2. **DynamoDB Stream Indexer** - Processes DynamoDB stream events and forwards meals to the OpenSearch indexer for search capabilities.

## 📌 Responsibilities

- Listen for `MealUploaded` events via EventBridge (triggered by upstream S3 uploads).
- Validate and transform meal metadata into structured DynamoDB records.
- Insert meal records into the `MealsRead` DynamoDB table.
- React to DynamoDB stream events on `INSERT` and `MODIFY`.
- Index new/updated meal records into OpenSearch by calling a library function.

## 🔑 Key AWS Resources

- **DynamoDB Table**: Stores structured meal records.
- **EventBridge Rule**: Triggers meal ingestion from S3 upload events.
- **DynamoDB Stream**: Triggers OpenSearch indexing on record change.
- **Lambda Functions**:
  - `mealUploadEventConsumer.js`
  - `dynamoStreamIndexer.js`

## 🧪 Environment Variables

| Variable Name         | Description                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `MEALS_TABLE`         | Name of the DynamoDB table |
| `OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT` | Endpoint of OS domain      |
| `AWS_REGION`          | AWS region                 |

## 🔁 Lambda Entry Points

- **mealUploadEventConsumer.js**

  - **Trigger**: EventBridge — specifically on `MealUploaded` events
  - **Action**: Validate and transform the event detail → create DynamoDB item → insert into `MealsRead` table

- **dynamoStreamIndexer.js**
  - Trigger: DynamoDB stream (INSERT events)
  - Action: Format and forward meals to OpenSearch

## 🧯 Error Handling

- Each Lambda is wrapped with try/catch blocks and logs detailed error messages.
- Invalid records are logged and skipped (no retries currently).
- Future improvements may include DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) support.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for transformation and validation logic
- Integration tests for end-to-end meal ingestion
- Mock S3, DynamoDB, and EventBridge events in test suite

## 🧰 Tools

- vegorla review
- AWS SDK v3
- Jest for testing
- Lambda Powertools (planned)
- OpenSearch Client (used downstream)

## 🔐 Security

- Principle of least privilege in IAM roles
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- No sensitive data stored in logs

## 🚀 Deployment

- Managed via Serverless Framework
- Separate stages for `dev`, `staging`, and `prod`
- CI/CD pipeline will run tests and deploy Lambdas

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

- Add Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) for failed events
- Add tracing with AWS X-Ray
- Use schema validation (e.g., with Joi)
- Index updated records (MODIFY events)
